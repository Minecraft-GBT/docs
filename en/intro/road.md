# \[Semi-Original\]\[NTE 0.2.0+\]\[Free\] GBT Series Traffic Signs Pack

> [!NOTE]
> The CC-BY-NC 4.0 International agreement does not apply to this pack.

This package is nominally part of the GBT series, but it is actually calculated separately from the GBT series versions, with different production processes and update timings.

Due to different operational logic, they are released separately, and the data for each package is counted separately.

The GBT series main package can be used independently without installing NTE; please do not confuse them.

## Formal Introduction

The road traffic signage pack released this time aims to solve the road traffic sign issues that various road MODs/add-on packs have not fully addressed. It was originally planned for the GBT mod, but since the release of the MOD is indefinitely delayed, this add-on is released in advance as a preliminary version.

The road MODs I have used so far have not fully restored GB 5768.2, and even if some have been partially restored, they lack some signs. Therefore, based on the NTE decorative objects, I created a very simple add-on. After the official version is released, it is likely that only bugs will be fixed without adding new content.

Considering the customizability of road signs, this add-on specifically releases some templates that need customization in PSD format. With just a few lines of text changes and a few lines of JSON writing, you can customize your own road signs.

Due to the limited time and my lack of modeling experience, the modeling of the sign poles is really hard to describe, and I hope someone skilled can help me improve it.

Please wait for the official release for more information.
