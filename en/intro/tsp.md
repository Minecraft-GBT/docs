This package is nominally part of the GBT series, but it is actually calculated separately from the GBT series versions, with different production processes and update timings.

Due to different operational logic, they are released separately, and the data for each package is counted separately.

The GBT series main package can be used independently without installing NTE; please do not confuse them.

## Formal Introduction

This release of the road traffic sign pack aims to address the issues that various road MODs/add-ons have not fully resolved. Originally planned as part of the GBT module, this add-on is being released in advance due to the indefinite delay of the MOD release.

Currently, none of the road MODs I have used fully replicate GB 5768.2. Even those that partially replicate it are missing some signs. Therefore, I created a very simple add-on based on NTE decorations. The official version will likely only fix bugs without adding new content.

At present, only some basic signs have been replicated, and most signs larger than one grid have not yet been updated.
