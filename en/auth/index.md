# Application

This tutorial explains how to apply for further use of the GBT pack.

“Further” here refers to applying for one or more of the following uses on servers: use / reproduction / integration / modification.

Applications can be made via MTRBBS / MTRCMU / email / QQ.

> [!NOTE]
> The GBT mod can be used on servers without authorization, and reproduction, integration, and modification do not require authorization but should follow the MIT protocol.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you wish to apply for server use, please include the server name. Additionally, unless specifically stated, integration/modification permissions will not be granted; if needed, please specify. Individuals applying for integration/modification/reproduction permissions should indicate contact information and the platform for reproduction (if applying for reproduction), in which case there is no need to attach the server name.

> [!WARNING]
> Applications for the road traffic sign pack are not currently being accepted. Please wait for the official release.
